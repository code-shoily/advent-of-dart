# Advent of Dart

My attempts to solve [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles with the [Dart](http://dartlang.org).

All solutions codes are located in `lib/year_<year>/day_<day>` where `year` is the year and `day` is the day of the year I'm solving. `solutions.dart` exports all days for shorter test files.

The input files are located in `lib/data/<year>/data_<day>_<part>.txt` where `part` is the part of the `day` that `year` the data belongs. So far I only encountered same dataset for both the parts but you never know.

Or you can run `pub run bin/generate.dart <year> <day>` to generate some boilerplate for you.

Run `pub run test` to run all the tests.
